# shopify-challenge

Internship challenge for Fall 2021 roles.

## Description

This is a mock image repository build using Node.js and Vue.js. 
It emulates user uploads and deletions, with private and public viewing. 
Images with public permission can be viewed by anyone, private images can only
be viewed by the user who uploaded.
